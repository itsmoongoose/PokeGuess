## __Pokemon Index and Information - Asynchronous Programming & API__
### __Project Description__
__*Scope and Functionality*__ - This website can be used to load information about Pokemon. Once the user enters the name of a valid Pokemon, the website will fetch the data from a [public Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) and display it on this website.

The following will be displayed for each Pokemon that is searched:
- Species Name
- Sprite of the Character
- Height
- Weight
- Base Experience
- Abilities
- Type Name(s) and Icon(s)

__*Motivation*__ - This program allows me to demonstrate my knowledge of asynchronous programming with JavaScript and using API's.

### __Technology Stack__
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- git 2.49.0.windows.1
